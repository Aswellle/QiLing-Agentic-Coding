export function getExitWorktreeToolPrompt(): string {
  return `Exit a worktree session created by EnterWorktree and return the session to the original working directory.

## Scope

This tool ONLY operates on worktrees created by EnterWorktree in this session. It will NOT touch:
- Worktrees you created manually with \`git worktree add\`
- Worktrees from a previous session (even if created by EnterWorktree then)
- The directory you're in if EnterWorktree was never called

If called outside an EnterWorktree session, the tool is a **no-op**.

## When to Use

- The user explicitly asks to "exit the worktree", "leave the worktree", "go back", or otherwise end the worktree session
- Do NOT call this proactively — only when the user asks

## Parameters

- \`action\` (required): \`"keep"\` or \`"remove"\`
  - \`"keep"\` — leave the worktree directory and branch intact on disk
  - \`"remove"\` — delete the worktree directory and its branch
- \`discard_changes\` (optional, default false): only meaningful with \`action: "remove"\`. If the worktree has uncommitted changes, the tool will REFUSE to remove it unless this is set to \`true\`.
